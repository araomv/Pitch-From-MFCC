# Pitch-From-MFCC
This repository is related to the paper: Achuth Rao, M. V., and Prasanta Kumar Ghosh. "Pitch Prediction from Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients Using Sparse Spectrum Recovery." (https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/papers_pdf/Achuth_NCC_2017.pdf)

The code is given only for the pitch estimation from fiter bank energies (fbe). The estimation of fbe from mfcc can be done in various ways mentioned in the paper (supervised or unsupervised ways). 
Run "estimate_pitch_from_mfcc_demo.m" for the demo.

Let me know if you have any questions.
