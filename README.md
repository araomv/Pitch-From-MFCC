# Pitch-From-MFCC
This repository is related to the paper: Achuth Rao, M. V., and Prasanta Kumar Ghosh. "Pitch Prediction from Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients Using Sparse Spectrum Recovery." (https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/papers_pdf/Achuth_NCC_2017.pdf)

The code is given only for the pitch estimation from fiter bank energies (fbe). 
Run "estimate_pitch_from_mfcc_demo.m" for the demo.

Let me know if you have any questions.
